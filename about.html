                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Angel G. Arroyo Buitrago, and I am a first-generation Hispanic computer science
                    major at the University of Maryland. I grew up without consistent access to advanced
                    technology at home, so I learned coding slowly, teaching myself line by line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those experiences shaped how I see artificial intelligence today. I use AI tools to test code,
                    explore ideas, and learn faster,but I also see how easily people can be left behind when they
                    don’t have the same access, training, or support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This blog grows out of a position paper I wrote for English 101 about AI, training, and the
                    future of work. My goal is to move that academic argument into a public space where students,
                    workers, and community members can think about what kind of AI-powered future Maryland should build.

                <h2>What I Believe</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI should expand opportunity, not restrict it.</li>
                    <li>Every worker deserves fair access to training and digital tools.</li>
                    <li>First-generation and low-income students should not be left behind in AI transitions.</li>
                    <li>Governments, schools, and companies share responsibility for building fair systems.</li>

                <p>
                    These are some of the key reports and articles that informed my research on AI and the future of work:
                </p>
                <ul class="resource-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Brookings Institution – Generative AI & Workforce Geography</strong><br>

                    <li>
                        <strong>White House & European Commission – AI and the Future of Work</strong><br>
                        A joint policy report about how AI reshapes skill demands and why training systems matter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>National Academies / Carnegie Mellon – Workforce Implications of AI</strong><br>
                        Investigates how institutions, not just technology, shape AI’s impact on workers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>New Solutions – Equitably Applying AI in the U.S. Workforce</strong><br>

                        Research on worker stress, upskilling, and reskilling shows that training and support reduce fear and
                        improve long-term outcomes.

                    You can search for these titles online if you want to read more about how AI is transforming work
                    and why training policies are so important.
