                <h2>Why AI Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence shapes the job market that students and workers in Maryland are entering
                    right now. Tools like ChatGPT can debug code, draft emails, and summarize complex topics in seconds.
                    Those benefits are real, but so is the pressure. Many of us wonder how long our current skills will
                    stay relevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research from Brookings shows that AI will transform tasks in about
                    <strong><span id="jobs-percent">0</span>% of jobs across the United States</strong>, with some regions
                    facing more disruption than others. Communities with weaker digital access are more vulnerable,
                    especially when training opportunities are limited.

                <p>
                    AI doesn’t automatically replace humans, but it does change what counts as “enough” skill.
                    Workers in routine-heavy jobs, or in communities with poor internet access, often face the greatest risk.

                <h2>What the Research Says</h2>
                <p>
                    Policy research from the White House and the European Commission shows that AI increases skill
                    demands and widens gaps between high-skill and low-skill workers if training systems are weak.
                    Other studies find that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Workers feel more stress when AI enters their jobs without clear guidance or training.</li>
                    <li>Companies that invest in upskilling and reskilling see better performance and stability.</li>
                    <li>Communities with strong digital infrastructure experience smoother transitions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Story: Learning Tech Without Tech</h2>
                <p>
                    I didn’t grow up with high-speed internet, gaming PCs, or robotics clubs. I learned coding slowly,
                    line by line, often on borrowed devices or limited public computers. That experience taught me how
                    powerful technology can be when you finally have access—and how unfair it feels when you don’t.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, AI tools help me test code, understand errors, and explore ideas faster. But I also know that
                    if training and access aren’t shared fairly, AI will deepen the divide between those who can keep up
                    and those who never get the chance.
