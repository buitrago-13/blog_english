    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
        I am a first generation Hispanic computer science major at the University of Maryland.
        I learned coding slowly, often on borrowed or limited devices. AI helps me learn faster,
        but it also raises the stakes for everyone who never had equal access.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technology can change a life, but only with the right tools, training, and support.

    <p>

        Tools like ChatGPT speed up work and expand possibility, but also create pressure and uncertainty.
